# About this Project

This is a wrapper Chef cookbook designed to customize the behavior of the 
[zookeeper-cluster](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/zookeeper-cluster) community 
cookbook.  It is intended as companion code for my blog post [Building a Developer Virtualization Lab - Part 3](https://www.gastongonzalez.com).
