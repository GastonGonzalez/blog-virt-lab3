# About this Project

This is a wrapper Chef cookbook designed to customize the behavior of the 
[zookeeper-cluster](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/zookeeper-cluster) community 
cookbook.  It is intended as companion code for my blog post [Building a Developer Virtualization Lab - Part 3](https://www.gastongonzalez.com/tech-blog/2017/1/16/building-a-developer-virtualization-lab-part-3).

It should be noted that this Vagrantfile is specific to my environment. However, it can easily be modified based on your needs. It is strongly recommended that my posts on the _Building a Developer Virtualizatio_ series (e.g., part 1, 2 and 3) are consulted.
